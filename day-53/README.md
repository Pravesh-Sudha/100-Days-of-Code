# Day 53 of 100DaysofCode

Feeling excited to start Day 53 of 100 DaysOfCode, today, I practiced MongoDB on w3schools's website. This website provides a beginner guide to MongoDB, how it works, creating, updating and deleting operations and many more. For referneces, [Click](https://w3schools.com) to know more.

## How the project works?

Clone this repository or simply refer to the README for a quick reference on how my repository works. Feel free to customize the commands based on your needs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pravesh-Sudha/100-Days-Of-Code.git
cd day-53
```

# MongoDB Practice on W3Schools

This README documents my practice with MongoDB on W3Schools. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. In this practice, I explored some key components and concepts related to MongoDB.

## Key Components of MongoDB

### 1. **Collections**
   - Collections are the equivalent of tables in a relational database. They store documents in a MongoDB database. Each document can have a different structure, which provides great flexibility.

### 2. **Documents**
   - Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. They are similar to rows in a relational database but store data in BSON (Binary JSON) format. BSON is a binary representation of JSON, which allows for the storage of various data types.

### 3. **Fields**
   - Fields are the individual pieces of data within a document. Each document can have a different set of fields, and field values can be of various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and embedded documents.

### 4. **Indexes**
   - MongoDB supports indexing to optimize query performance. Indexes help you quickly access the data you need, similar to how indexes work in traditional relational databases.

### 5. **Queries**
   - MongoDB provides a powerful query language for searching and retrieving data. You can filter documents based on criteria and use operators to perform various operations on the data.

### 6. **Aggregation Framework**
   - MongoDB's Aggregation Framework allows you to perform complex data transformations and analysis on your data. It includes a variety of stages for filtering, grouping, sorting, and projecting data.

### 7. **Replication**
   - MongoDB supports replication for high availability. It maintains multiple copies of your data across different servers, ensuring that your data remains accessible even in the event of a server failure.

### 8. **Sharding**
   - Sharding is used to distribute data across multiple servers to improve scalability. It allows MongoDB to handle large datasets by partitioning them across multiple machines.

### 9. **Transactions**
   - MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, providing data integrity and consistency across multiple operations. This is especially useful when you need to perform multiple operations that depend on each other.

### 10. **Security**
   - MongoDB offers various security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption. These help protect your data and ensure that only authorized users can access it.

Feel free to explore and experiment with MongoDB's features to get a better understanding of its capabilities.

Happy learning!
