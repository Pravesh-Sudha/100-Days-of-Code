# Day 63 of 100DaysOfCode

Feeling excited to start Day 63 of 100 DaysOfCode, today, I watched a full tutorial video on MERN Stack by [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/7CqJlxBYj-M?si=RxKKDgN14uuhctNc). In this tutorial, I get to know about the basics of MERN(MongoDb, Express.js, React and Node) by building an exercise tracker application. 

## How the project works?

Clone this repository or simply refer to the README for a quick reference on how my repository works. Feel free to customize the commands based on your needs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pravesh-Sudha/100-Days-Of-Code.git

## Introduction

The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for building modern web applications. It consists of four main components:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for Node.js.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server.

This tutorial will guide you through building an exercise tracker application, integrating each component of the MERN stack to create a seamless and efficient development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Project Overview

The exercise tracker application is a simple web app that allows users to log and track their exercises. It demonstrates the fundamentals of creating a full-stack application, from database management to frontend development.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. In our project, MongoDB will be used to store exercise data.

## Express.js

Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications. In our project, Express.js will handle server-side logic and API routes.

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components. In our project, React will be used for the frontend, enabling a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It facilitates the building of scalable network applications. In our project, Node.js will be the runtime environment for the Express.js server.

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorial, follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section of the [main README](./README.md).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `server`: Contains the Express.js server and backend logic.
- `client`: Houses the React frontend application.
- `models`: Defines MongoDB schema models for exercises and users.
- `routes`: Contains API route definitions for CRUD operations.
- `public`: Holds static assets.
- `views`: Contains HTML templates.

## Tutorial Sections

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository, install dependencies, and set up the project structure.
2. **Backend Development**: Create the Express.js server, define MongoDB models, and set up API routes.
3. **Frontend Development**: Build React components for creating, reading, updating, and deleting exercises.
4. **Integration**: Connect the frontend and backend to create a seamless full-stack application.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a hosting service like Heroku.

Follow each section of the tutorial to gain a comprehensive understanding of building applications with the MERN stack.

Happy coding!
