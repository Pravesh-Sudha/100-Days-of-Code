# Day 55 of 100DaysofCode

Feeling excited to start Day 55 of 100 DaysOfCode, today, I get to know about Grafana Fundamentals on their offical Website. Their website provides a beginner guide to grafana, how it works, and I learnt how to use Grafana to set up a monitoring solution for your application. For referneces, [Click](https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals/) to view the site.

## How the project works?

Clone this repository or simply refer to the README for a quick reference on how my repository works. Feel free to customize the commands based on your needs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pravesh-Sudha/100-Days-Of-Code.git
cd day-55
```

## What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source analytics and monitoring platform designed to visualize, analyze, and interact with data. It allows users to create, explore, and share dashboards, enabling them to monitor various metrics and data sources in real-time. Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including databases, cloud services, and custom APIs.

## How it Works

### Data Sources:

Grafana can connect to various data sources, such as:

- **Prometheus:** An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.
- **Graphite:** A scalable real-time graphing system.
- **Elasticsearch:** A distributed search and analytics engine.
- **InfluxDB:** A high-performance, distributed, and scalable time-series database.
- **Cloud Platforms:** Grafana can integrate with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to pull in metrics and logs.

### Dashboards:

Dashboards in Grafana are customizable, interactive views that display data from chosen data sources. Users can create and organize panels, each representing a specific metric or visualization. Grafana provides a variety of visualization options, including graphs, tables, heatmaps, and more.

### Plugins:

Grafana's extensibility is enhanced through plugins. Users can install plugins to add additional data sources, panels, and features, allowing customization based on specific needs.

### Alerts:

Grafana supports alerting based on defined thresholds and conditions. Users can set up notifications via various channels like email, Slack, or other integrations to stay informed about important changes or issues.

## Fundamentals

### Querying and Filtering:

Grafana enables users to query and filter data to create meaningful visualizations. Users can apply filters to focus on specific time ranges, hosts, or other dimensions, ensuring a tailored and relevant representation of data.

### Templating:

Templating in Grafana allows users to create dynamic dashboards by using variables. These variables can represent aspects like data sources, hosts, or other parameters, providing a flexible and interactive dashboard experience.

### Annotations:

Annotations are used to mark events or points of interest on graphs. They help users correlate data with specific occurrences, making it easier to understand the context of changes in metrics.

### Permissions and Sharing:

Grafana provides robust access control mechanisms. Users can set permissions to control who can view, edit, or administer dashboards. Additionally, Grafana facilitates sharing dashboards and panels through unique URLs or snapshot exports.
