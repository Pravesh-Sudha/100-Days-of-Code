# Day 16 of 100DaysofCode

Feeling excited to start Day 15 of 100 DaysOfCode, today, I learnt about python, its basics through a practical project in a great Video by [Travis Media](https://youtu.be/f1E1NvcRvdc?si=MSo_B3bcEtLBdTl8). This video includes fundamentals of Python, How it is used in Real life project.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with Python, you need to install it on your system. Here are the steps for installation:

- **Step 1:** Download Python: Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.

- **Step 2:** Installation: Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system. Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

- **Step 3:** Verify Installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   python --version


## Usage

Clone this repository or simply refer to the README for a quick reference on using the basic Linux commands. Feel free to customize the commands based on your needs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pravesh-Sudha/100-Days-Of-Code.git
cd day-16
python3 project.py
```

## Variables

In Python, you can declare variables without specifying their data types. Here's how to declare and use variables:

```bash
# Variable declaration
my_variable = 42

# Variable usage
print(my_variable)
```

## Loops

Python provides various types of loops, including for and while loops. Here's an example of a for loop:

```bash
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries in Python are used to store key-value pairs. Here's how to create and use dictionaries:

```bash
# Dictionary creation
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}

# Accessing values
print(my_dict["name"])
```

## If-Else Statements

Conditional statements like if, else, and elif are used to control the flow of your program. Here's an example:

```bash
# If-else statement
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

## Lists

Lists are used to store collections of items. Here's how to create and manipulate lists:

```bash
# List creation
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Adding an item
my_list.append(6)

# Accessing items
print(my_list[2])
```

## Functions

Functions allow you to encapsulate and reuse code. Here's how to define and call a function:

```bash
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Function call
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)
```
