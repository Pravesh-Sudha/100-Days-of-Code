# Day 22 of 100DaysofCode

Feeling excited to start Day 22 of 100 DaysOfCode, today, I learnt about gitlab fundamentals in a great video by [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/PGyhBwLyK2U?si=eertNUtjOPGNjpno). This video provides a beginner guide to Gitlab, how to setup account and how to build and deploy application on cloud providers.
