# Day 59 of 100DaysofCode

Feeling excited to start Day 59 of 100 DaysOfCode, today, I created a DevOps Converter Project which converts a mp4 video file to mp3 audio file using Kuberenetes, Postgres, MonogDB, Helm Charts and RabbitMQ Deployments. This project helped me learn about kubernetes fundamentals, how to install Helm charts and stored files in MongoDB, etc
