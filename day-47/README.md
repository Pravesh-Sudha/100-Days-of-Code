## Introduction

The Weather App is a simple web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to check the weather conditions for a specific city by entering its name. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Search by City**: Users can enter the name of a city in the search input and click the search button to retrieve weather information.

- **Dynamic Weather Display**: The app displays the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

- **Weather Icons**: Weather icons change to represent the current weather conditions, such as rain, clouds, clear skies, drizzle, mist, and snow.

- **Error Handling**: If an invalid city name is entered, an error message is displayed.

## Usage

To use the Weather App, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. In the "Enter your city name" input field, type the name of the city for which you want to check the weather.

3. Click the search button (the magnifying glass icon) to initiate the weather lookup.

4. The app will display the city name, current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather conditions.

5. If an invalid city name is entered, an error message will be displayed.

## Customization

You can customize the Weather App by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to:

- Change the app's appearance by updating the CSS styles in the `style.css` file.

- Modify the list of weather conditions and their corresponding icons in the JavaScript code for different visual representations.
