# Day 11 of 100DaysofCode

Feeling excited to start Day 11 of 100 DaysOfCode, today, I learnt about the Linux commands in a great Video by [Train With Shubhum](https://youtu.be/39oyFIStuaI?si=YEAFKGAWLsggTxJi). Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various Linux distributions. It enables users to interact with hardware and software resources, providing a stable and customizable platform for computing. Linux supports diverse applications, from servers to personal devices, and embodies collaborative development, security, and flexibility principles.

## Prerequisites

Before using these commands, ensure you have one of the following environments set up:

- **Ubuntu Desktop:** Install Ubuntu on your local machine by following the official installation guide at [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):** If you're using Windows, set up WSL by following the instructions at [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

- **Amazon EC2 Instance:** If you prefer a cloud environment, create an Amazon EC2 instance running a Linux distribution. Follow the steps outlined in the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/run-your-app-using-amazon-ec2/).
