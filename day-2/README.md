# Day 2 of 100DaysofCode

Starting my Day 2 of 100 DaysOfCode, today, I learnt about the Terraform overview and setup locally.

## 02 - Overview + Setup

## Install Terraform

Official installation instructions from HashiCorp: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli

## AWS Account Setup

AWS Terraform provider documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication

1) create non-root AWS user
2) Add the necessary IAM roles (e.g. AmazonEC2FullAccess)
3) Save Access key + secret key (or use AWS CLI `aws configure` -- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

## Hello World

`./main.tf` contains minimal configuration to provision an EC2 instance.

1) `aws configure`
2) `terraform init`:
    * This command initializes a Terraform working directory by downloading the necessary providers and modules specified in your configuration files.

    * It sets up the backend configuration if you're using remote state storage, where Terraform stores the state of your infrastructure in a remote location. 
    
    * When you run terraform init, Terraform examines the configuration files (usually in HashiCorp Configuration Language or HCL) and downloads the required plugins and modules.

3) `terraform plan`:
    * This command creates an execution plan by comparing the current state of your infrastructure (from the Terraform state file) with the desired state specified in your configuration files.

    * It calculates the difference between the current and desired states and presents you with a detailed plan of what Terraform will create, update, or delete to bring your infrastructure in line with your configuration.

    * Running terraform plan is a crucial step because it helps you preview the changes that will be made before actually applying them. This can prevent accidental changes or errors.

4) `terraform apply`:
    * This command applies the changes specified in your configuration files to your infrastructure.

    * After reviewing the plan generated by terraform plan, you can run terraform apply to execute the changes.

    * Terraform will create, update, or delete resources based on the plan and update the state file accordingly to reflect the new state of the infrastructure
    
    * You'll usually be prompted to confirm your intention to apply the changes before they are actually made.


# Here's the typical workflow when using these commands:

- Initialize the project: Run terraform init in your project directory to set up the necessary providers and modules. In `main.tf` example, the command will initiallize the aws provider. 

- Plan your changes: Run terraform plan to generate an execution plan and review the changes Terraform will make. In `main.tf` example, the command will plan the changes which will show that an `aws_instance_example` has to be added in the file 

- Apply the changes: If you're satisfied with the plan, run terraform apply to apply the changes and update your infrastructure. In `main.tf` example, the command will apply the changes and create an EC2 instance of your provided images. 

- It's important to note that Terraform tracks the state of your infrastructure in a state file. This file should be stored securely and managed properly, especially when working with a team or multiple environments.

- Terraform's approach to infrastructure as code makes it easier to manage, version, and collaborate on infrastructure changes, reducing manual errors and providing reproducibility.
