# 100 Days of Code: Terraform, Linux, and DevOps ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Welcome to the **100 Days of Code** challenge focused on learning Terraform, Linux, and DevOps practices! This repository is a collection of my journey as I dive into the exciting world of infrastructure as code and automation. Over the course of 100 days, I will be dedicating time each day to enhance my skills and knowledge in these powerful tools and practices.

## Overview

In this repository, I will document my 100-day journey of hands-on learning in Terraform, Ansible, and DevOps principles. The aim is to gain a strong foundation in creating and managing infrastructure, automating deployment, and implementing DevOps practices to streamline the development lifecycle.

## Goals

My main goals for this challenge include:

- **Mastery of Terraform:** I will learn how to define and manage infrastructure as code using Terraform. This includes creating, updating, and destroying resources in various cloud providers.

- **Ansible Proficiency:** I intend to become proficient in Ansible, understanding its playbooks, roles, and modules. I'll explore automation of configuration management and deployment processes.

- **DevOps Understanding:** Throughout this journey, I'll gain a deeper understanding of DevOps principles, continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and how these concepts integrate with Terraform and Ansible.

## Progress

I will regularly update my progress in the [log](#log) section below. Each day, I'll provide insights into what I learned, the challenges I faced, and the achievements I unlocked. This documentation will serve as a record of my growth over the 100-day period.

## Resources

I'll be using a variety of resources to aid my learning, including:

- Online tutorials and documentation from official Terraform, Ansible, and DevOps websites.
- Books and e-books on Terraform, Ansible, and DevOps best practices.
- YouTube videos and online courses for practical demonstrations and hands-on exercises.

## Log

### Day 1: Getting Started with Terraform
- Pre-history of Cloud
- What is Terraform ?
- Learned about Terraform's HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

### Day 2: Terraform Modules
- Installation
- Created an Ec2 instance with aws provider.
- Learnt about `terraform init`,`terraform plan`, `terraform apply` command.

### Day 3: AWS S3 + DynamoDb
- Terraform basics
- Created a S3 bucket on AWS.
- Learnt about DynamoDb, RDS instance, Load balancer, Route 53 DNS Config.

### Day 4: Terraform Variables
- Different types of Variable
- Input variable and output variable.
- Learnt about variable file , .tfvars file and other ways of using variables.

### Day 5: Terraform Advance features
- Different types of Expressions like string, number, bool
- Operators and conditionals.
- Expressions Splat expressions, Dynamic blocks, Type constraints and Version constraints
- Numeric and String functions
- Other functions like Collection, encoding, date & time, IP network, etc.

### Day 6: Terraform Module
- Created a Web App module
- Used module like variable, DNS, networking and storage

### Day 7: Terraform Environments
- Created different environments 
    - Staging
    - Development
    - Production
- Created different Workspaces

### Day 8: Terraform Testing
- Code Rot which means that with time your code get degraded like deprecated dependencies, unpinned versions,etc.
- Test your Changes.
- There are built-in checks (Terraform plan) and external tool like tflint and terratest
- Manual testing (init -> plan -> apply -> destroy)
- Terratest: It is an external tool that allow us to define test within an actual programming language like Go-Lang or Javascript rather than bash script.
